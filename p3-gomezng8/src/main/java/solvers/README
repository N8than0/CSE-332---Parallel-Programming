All solvers in this folder use the Bellman-Ford algorithm in slightly different ways to achieve the edge relaxation
  InParallel: Uses RelaxInTask.java to relax incoming edges
  OutParallelBad: Uses RelaxOutTaskBad.java to relax outgoing edges
  OutParallelLock: Uses RelaxOutTaskLock.java to relax outgoing edges
